 * A compact method of storing device resources. These are meant to allow
 * SoC independent interaction with devices. For instance, for device foo,
 * clk 0 is always the functional clock and clk 1 is always the interface
 * clock, even though their device/clock framework IDs may differ. Only
 * resources utilized by drivers within the System Firmware are included.
 *
 * Not all devices will have the full set of resources supported by a driver,
 * if the missing resources are at the end of the resource list, the
 * resoure table can just define fewer resources. If the resource is in
 * the middle of the resource list, the resource table should include
 * RESOURCE_xxx_NONE for the missing resources.
